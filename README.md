`Doit` is a command-line interface that lists and runs your npm scripts in any project that has a `package.json` file.
This CLI is using [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) and React.

I did a talk about this at a local React meetup, here are the slides: https://slides.com/reneeghattas/do-it-cli

# Install

Install this package using npm:

```
npm i -g doit
```

# Usage

Simple run `doit` in the same directory as your `package.json` file and see a list of all your scripts.

```
‚ùØ doit
```
